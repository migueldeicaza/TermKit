 * Progress bar can indicate progress of an activity visually.

 * The progressbar can operate in two modes, percentage mode, or
 * activity mode.  The progress bar starts in percentage mode and
 * setting the `fraction` property will reflect on the UI the progress
 * made so far.   Activity mode is used when the application has no
 * way of knowing how much time is left, and is started when you invoke
 * the Pulse() method.    You should call the `pulse` method repeatedly as
 * your application makes progress.
