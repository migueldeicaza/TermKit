 * The Key enumeration contains special encoding for some keys, but can also
 * encode all the unicode values that can be passed.
 *
 * If the SpecialMask is set, then the value is that of the special mask,
 * otherwise, the value is the one of the lower bits (as extracted by CharMask)
 *
 *  Control keys are the values between 1 and 26 corresponding to Control-A to Control-Z
 *
 * UnicodeScalars are also stored here, the letter 'A" for example is encoded as a value 65 (not surfaced in the enum).
